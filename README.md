# baseconv
Converts numbers from one base to another base (like from binary to hexadecimal). Can also convert uncommon bases, too! (Like base-5 to base-15.)

This was an assignment about testing and quality in simple software projects for school.

Initially, this program was simply used for uncommon bases, but was converted to actually handle errors properly, and use proper design patterns.
